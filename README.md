# üì∞ **Bing News Analytics Platform Using Microsoft Fabric**

‚ú® **Overview**

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data engineering pipeline** built with **Microsoft Fabric**, designed to process and analyze news data sourced from the **Bing API**. By utilizing tools like **Apache Spark**, **Pyspark**, **Delta Lake**, and **Power BI**, the pipeline ingests, transforms, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes insights from news articles.

üîç **Problem Statement**

News organizations and media platforms often face challenges in:

- Analyzing and categorizing large volumes of news data efficiently.
- Extracting meaningful insights from news content and provider data.
- Understanding sentiment trends in news articles.
- Building scalable, automated data pipelines for real-time insights.

This project addresses these challenges by processing Bing news data and extracting actionable insights using a fully automated pipeline.

‚öôÔ∏è **Tools and Technologies Used**

- **Data Ingestion & Transformation**: Apache Spark, Pyspark
- **Data Storage**: Delta Lake (Azure Data Lake)
- **Data Orchestration**: Microsoft Fabric, Azure Data Factory
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Machine Learning models
- **Visualization**: Power BI

üîë **Key Insights**

- **Sentiment Distribution**: Categorization of news articles by sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
- **News Categories**: Popular categories such as Sports, Politics, and Business dominate the news feed.
- **Top News Providers**: Insights into leading news agencies and their article contributions.
- **Trending Topics**: Extracted key trends and topics based on article frequency.

üî¢ **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

- **Flattened JSON**: Transformed nested JSON data from the Bing API into structured tables.

- **Incremental Loading**: Implemented incremental loading to keep the dataset up-to-date with the latest news articles.

üåÑ **Power BI Visualizations**

Key Visualizations:
- **AutoPilot Visualization**: A visualization automatically generated by Power BI‚Äôs AutoPilot.
- **User-Created Visualization**:
  - **Date Filter**: A dynamic date filter allows users to choose the date, with future dates automatically appearing due to the time-based nature of the API (updated every 10 hours).
  - **Data Table**: A table displaying key fields such as title, category, date published, URL, sentiment, and provider.
  - **Sentiment Cards**: Three cards showing the percentage distribution of negative, positive, and neutral sentiments in the news data.

üåê **Lessons Learned**

- **Apache Spark** enables handling large datasets efficiently in a distributed environment.
- **Power BI** is effective for transforming raw data into insightful, interactive reports.
- **Microsoft Fabric** simplifies orchestration of complex data pipelines across various tools.
