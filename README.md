## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. **Data Ingestion**
- Used **Data Factory** to connect to the Bing API.
- Extracted news articles in **JSON** format.
- Stored raw data in **OneLake’s Lake Database**.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
- Processed raw JSON files into structured **Delta tables**.
- Utilized **Spark Notebooks** in Synapse Data Engineering.
- Applied a predefined schema for better usability.

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**
- Leveraged **Synapse Data Science** to analyze news descriptions.
- Used a pre-trained text analysis model to classify sentiment as:
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Neutral
- Stored sentiment-enriched data as Delta tables in the Lake Database.

### 4. **Visualization with Power BI**
- Created a **dynamic dashboard** to display:
  - Latest news articles (published within the last 24 hours).
  - Sentiment distribution across news articles.
- Configured to update automatically with each pipeline run.

### 5. **Real-Time Alerts with Data Activator**
- Set up alerts for critical events (e.g., negative sentiment articles).
- Notifications delivered via **Microsoft Teams**.
